pandas
======================

简介
------------------

pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and
analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables
and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license. The name is derived
from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple
time periods for the same individuals. Its name is a play on the phrase "Python data analysis" itself.
Wes McKinney started building what would become pandas at AQR Capital while he was a researcher there
from 2007 to 2010.
